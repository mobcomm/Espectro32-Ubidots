# Espectro32-Ubidots
Espectro32 with Ubidots

This is a components/library for ESPectro32 development board made with `Espressif IoT Development Framework` ([ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)). We try to make it compatible with Arduino and PlatformIO.
Please check ESP-IDF docs for getting started instructions.

## ESPectro32

[ESPectro32](https://shop.makestro.com/product/espectro32/) is an IoT development board based-on ESP32 MCU, made by [DycodeX](https://dycodex.com).

ESPectro32 is official development board for Republic of IoT (RIoT) hackathon. Made possible by awesome collaboration of two countries' IoT and maker communities: Makestro (Indonesia) and MyIoTC (Malaysia).

## Using It

You can not use this library directly, as this is just a library or component (in ESP-IDF term). So, you need to "include" it in a project. Take a look [ESPectro32-IDF](https://github.com/dycodex/ESPectro32-IDF) repository to see how it's used in an ESP-IDF project. 

## Using with Arduino IDE

You can download this library and extract it to `Documents/Arduino/libraries` directory on Windows or `$HOME/Arduino/libraries` on Linux.

Then, you must extract the content of the `lib` directory inside this library to `Documents/Arduino/libraries` or `$HOME/Arduino/libraries` directory as well.
